# Issues

- calling `setButtonValue()` crashes the firmware (row 307 in `onProgramReady()`)
- calibration / save settings crash
- parameter callback?
- AUDIO_BLOCK_SIZE?
- left channel don't work anymore :(
- sometimes, mod amount, mod freq an cutoff knobs stop working
- filter and random (both) switches defaults?
