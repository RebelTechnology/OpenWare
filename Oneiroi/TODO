# Issues

- the first channel of each mux don't work and is being controlled by the second one
- calling `setButtonValue()` crashes the firmware (row 307 in `onProgramReady()`)
- random mode switch doesn't work (all positions except FX = 0)
- filter cutoff knob doesn't work well (was working before?)
