  * @brief The Disconnection Complete event occurs when a connection is terminated.
The status parameter indicates if the disconnection was successful or not. The
reason parameter indicates the reason for the disconnection if the disconnection
was successful. If the disconnection was not successful, the value of the
reason parameter can be ignored by the Host. For example, this can be the
case if the Host has issued the Disconnect command and there was a parameter
error, or the command was not presently allowed, or a Connection_Handle
that didn't correspond to a connection was given.

  * @brief The Encryption Change event is used to indicate that the change of the encryption
mode has been completed. The Connection_Handle will be a Connection_Handle
for an ACL connection. The Encryption_Enabled event parameter
specifies the new Encryption_Enabled parameter for the Connection_Handle
specified by the Connection_Handle event parameter. This event will occur on
both devices to notify the Hosts when Encryption has changed for the specified
Connection_Handle between two devices. Note: This event shall not be generated
if encryption is paused or resumed; during a role switch, for example.
The meaning of the Encryption_Enabled parameter depends on whether the
Host has indicated support for Secure Connections in the Secure_Connections_Host_Support
parameter. When Secure_Connections_Host_Support is
'disabled' or the Connection_Handle refers to an LE link, the Controller shall
only use Encryption_Enabled values 0x00 (OFF) and 0x01 (ON).

/**
  * @brief The Read Remote Version Information Complete event is used to indicate the
completion of the process obtaining the version information of the remote Controller
specified by the Connection_Handle event parameter. The Connection_Handle
shall be for an ACL connection.
The Version event parameter defines the specification version of the LE Controller.
The Manufacturer_Name event parameter indicates the manufacturer
of the remote Controller. The Subversion event parameter is controlled
by the manufacturer and is implementation dependent. The Subversion
event parameter defines the various revisions that each version of the Bluetooth
hardware will go through as design processes change and errors are
fixed. This allows the software to determine what Bluetooth hardware is being
used and, if necessary, to work around various bugs in the hardware.
When the Connection_Handle is associated with an LE-U logical link, the Version
event parameter shall be Link Layer VersNr parameter, the Manufacturer_Name
event parameter shall be the CompId parameter, and the Subversion
event parameter shall be the SubVersNr parameter.

most likely caused by incorrect SPI configuration on the external micro-controller.

the HS_STARTUP_TIME in the device configuration needs to be tuned.

buffer space has been freed in the Controller. Based on this information, and
the HC_Total_Num_ACL_Data_Packets and HC_Total_Num_Synchronous_-
Data_Packets return parameter of the Read_Buffer_Size command, the Host
can determine for which Connection_Handles the following HCI Data Packets
should be sent to the Controller. The Number Of Completed Packets event
must not be sent before the corresponding Connection Complete event. While
the Controller has HCI data packets in its buffer, it must keep sending the Number
Of Completed Packets event to the Host at least periodically, until it finally

Informtation provided includes type of radio activity and absolute time in system ticks when a new radio acitivity is schedule, if any. Application can use this information to schedule user activities synchronous to selected radio activitities. A command @ref aci_hal_set_radio_activity_mask is provided to enable radio activity events of user interests, by default no events are enabled.
User should take into account that enablinng radio events in application with intense radio activity could lead to a fairly high rate of events generated.
