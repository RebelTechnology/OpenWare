# OpenWare
Firmware for OWL devices

This repository contains firmware source code for several Rebel Technology devices and products, including Wizard, Alchemist and Magus.
To compile a project firmware, use STM32CubeMX to generate the library code structure (using the project .ioc file) and then compile with arm-gcc-none-eabi cross compiler. Debugging can be done with openocd.
